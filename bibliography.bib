@article{Doledec2000-fo,
	abstract = {The design and objective of a community study imply the
               selection of the appropriate ordination technique in terms of
               species response models and weighting options. In this paper, we
               start from the observation that existing two-table ordination
               techniques and related measures of niche breadth inevitably
               weight a sample in proportion to its abundance. We introduce a
               new multivariate method, which gives a more even weight to all
               sampling units, including those which are species poor or
               individual poor. We use this new method of analysis which we
               call OMI (for Outlying Mean Index) to address the question of
               niche separation and niche breadth. The Outlying Mean Index, or
               species marginality, measures the distance between the mean
               habitat conditions used by species (species centroid), and the
               mean habitat conditions of the sampling area (origin of the
               niche hyperspace), and OMI analysis places species along habitat
               conditions using a maximization of their mean OMI. Therefore,
               the position of the species depends on their niche deviation
               from a reference, which represents neither the mean nor the most
               abundant species, but a theoretical ubiquitous species that
               tolerates the most general habitat conditions (i.e., a
               hypothetical species uniformly distributed among habitat
               conditions). We demonstrate that OMI analysis is well suited for
               the investigation of multidimensional niche breadths in the case
               of strong limiting factors (e.g., meteorological conditions) or
               strong driving forces (e.g., longitudinal stream gradient).
               Furthermore, the analysis helps in finding which ecological
               factors are most important for community structure and
               organization and provides a separation of species based on their
               niche characteristics.},

@article{Durand2009-bh,
	abstract = {AbstractSince the early 1990s, M{\'e}t{\'e}o-France has used an
               automatic system combining three numerical models to simulate
               meteorological parameters, snow cover stratification, and
               avalanche risk at various altitudes, aspects, and slopes for a
               number of mountainous regions in France. Given the lack of
               sufficient directly observed long-term snow data, this
               ``SAFRAN''--Crocus--``MEPRA'' (SCM) model chain, usually applied
               to operational avalanche forecasting, has been used to carry out
               and validate retrospective snow and weather climate analyses for
               the 1958--2002 period. The SAFRAN 2-m air temperature and
               precipitation climatology shows that the climate of the French
               Alps is temperate and is mainly determined by atmospheric
               westerly flow conditions. Vertical profiles of temperature and
               precipitation averaged over the whole period for altitudes up to
               3000 m MSL show a relatively linear variation with altitude for
               different mountain areas with no constraint of that kind imposed
               by the analysis scheme itself. Over the observation period
               1958--2002, the overall trend corresponds to an increase in the
               annual near-surface air temperature of about 1$\,^{\circ}$C. However,
               variations are large at different altitudes and for different
               seasons and regions. This significantly positive trend is most
               obvious in the 1500--2000-m MSL altitude range, especially in
               the northwest regions, and exhibits a significant relationship
               with the North Atlantic Oscillation index over long periods.
               Precipitation data are diverse, making it hard to identify clear
               trends within the high year-to-year variability.},

@article{Choler2018-dz,
	abstract = {The topographical heterogeneity of mountain landscapes and the
              associated species turnover over short distances should prompt us
              to examine the relationships between climate and mountain plant
              distribution at a much finer scale than is commonly done. Here, I
              focused on the root zone temperature experienced by low-stature
              perennial-dominated plant communities of temperate mountains,
              which are seasonally covered by snow. Based on the analysis of
              multi-annual recordings of ground temperatures across a broad
              spectrum of plant communities, I propose a habitat template using
              Growing Degree Days (GDD) and Freezing Degree Days (FDD). These
              two indices summarize soil thermal conditions experienced during
              the favorable and the unfavorable period for growth. This
              heuristic framework allows refining our working hypotheses on the
              range shifts of mountain plants in response to recent and future
              climate change. Regional trends in climate variables controlling
              GDD and FDD indicate that the combination of earlier snow
              melt-out and higher summer temperatures have led to an overall
              increase in GDD over the last decades. However the persistence of
              cold episodes in spring and in fall along with the shorter snow
              coverage suggest that the positive effect of an extended growing
              season might be counteracted by the detrimental effects of
              increasing FDD. I thus hypothesize (i) a local-scale, downward
              shift of plant species along mesotopographical gradients, with
              marked species infilling in sparsely vegetated, long-lasting snow
              patches that contain vacant niches and (ii) a watershed-scale
              upward shift of subalpine species inhabiting south-exposed
              grasslands and able to cope with moderate FDD. This perspective
              challenges the simplistic view of an overall range shift of
              mountain plants along elevational gradients and calls for the
              improvement of models of snow cover dynamics and root zone
              temperature to draw up realistic scenarios of mountain vegetation
              changes under a warmer climate.},

@article{Martinez-Almoyna2020-lw,
	abstract = {While soil ecosystems undergo important modifications due to
               global change, the effect of soil properties on plant
               distributions is still poorly understood. Plant growth is not
               only controlled by soil physico-chemistry but also by microbial
               activities through the decomposition of organic matter and the
               recycling of nutrients essential for plants. A growing body of
               evidence also suggests that plant functional traits modulate
               species? response to environmental gradients. However, no study
               has yet contrasted the importance of soil physico-chemistry,
               microbial activities and climate on plant species distributions,
               while accounting for how plant functional traits can influence
               species-specific responses. Using hierarchical effects in a
               multi-species distribution model, we investigate how four
               functional traits related to resource acquisition (plant height,
               leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio, leaf dry matter content and
               specific leaf area) modulate the response of 44 plant species to
               climatic variables, soil physico-chemical properties and
               microbial decomposition activity (i.e. exoenzymatic activities)
               in the French Alps. Our hierarchical trait-based model allowed
               to predict well 41 species according to the TSS statistic. In
               addition to climate, the combination of soil C/N, as a measure
               of organic matter quality, and exoenzymatic activity, as a
               measure of microbial decomposition activity, strongly improved
               predictions of plant distributions. Plant traits played an
               important role. In particular, species with conservative traits
               performed better under limiting nutrient conditions but were
               outcompeted by exploitative plants in more favorable
               environments. We demonstrate tight associations between
               microbial decomposition activity, plant functional traits
               associated to different resource acquisition strategies and
               plant distributions. This highlights the importance of
               plant?soil linkages for mountain plant distributions. These
               results are crucial for biodiversity modelling in a world where
               both climatic and soil systems are undergoing profound and rapid
